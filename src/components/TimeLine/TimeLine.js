      <SectionText>
      My name is Michael and I am a Software Developer currently trying to gain practical experience in the tech industry.<br/> I have always been extremely passionate about technology which eventually prompted my choice to study AI and Robotics at the University of Bedfordshire in 2013. At the University, I picked up essential programming skills in Java and Python, as well as database management skills with SQL.<br/> Unfortunately, due to issues at home I was forced to return to my home country in 2016. A year later I would enroll into Baze University, Abuja in the Software Engineering course which I successfully completed in 2023.<br/>
      I have had over a decadeâ€™s worth of practice with programming and now, upon completion of my BSc Software Engineering program, I feel it is the right time to seek work experience in the industry.
